                        ASLAI combines computer vision and machine learning to create an artificial intelligence model
                        that recognizes the American sign Language (ASL) alphabet. With the use of convolutional neural 
                        networks, we were able to train a model given a dataset of hand gestures to predict the letter 
                        the user was signing. The model was then imported to a webpage we created to allow users to have
                        a more apealing and easier to navigate UI.

                        Upon completion of the Codedex HTML course, we were assigned the task to create a restaurant menu 
                        using only HTML. Using basic fundamental concepts of HTML, we were able to create a page for a 
                        fictional restaurant along with an order form. As of the latest update to the repo, nothing 
                        happens when an order is submitted. But the project can still be used for future ideas.

                        last update to The Game, we still need to save high scores locally to the user's machine, but 
                        the game is still fun and playable! Below is a picture of our main menu and a snippet of game play.

                        With the use of machine learning, this project aims to create and train an artificial intelligence 
                        model that can accurately predict the genre of a song given the correpsonding song's spectrogram. 
                        An existing dataset on GitHub was used for this project, and the model was trained using both Google 
                        Colab and Jupyter Notebook. As of the last update to the project, the model has ~60% accuracy. A 
                        report with my findings, confusion matricies, and list of short comings as well as possible improvments
                        that can be made to increase the model accuracy are available in the project repository.

                    - I have been a server and a bartender for Texas Roadhouse for six years. I have experience working collaboratively
                    with a team of servers and bartenders as well as individually. I have worked three weddings, two quiceñeras, and 
                    two special events.
                    <br>
                    - I love to run. I especially enjoy racing a 5K, but I am currently in training for my first ever marathon! 
                    The Garmin Marathon will take place in Tucson, AZ later this year, and I hope to do well. Also, when I become a 
                    better developer, I would like to link my Strava to this page so it updates my total miles ran per week after I 
                    have completed a run. 
                    <br>
                    - I have a dog named Pixie. She was a rescue dog found at our local shelter. She was found in an alley at a malnourished
                    29 lbs., but she is very active, playful, and happier now. Her favorite treat is yak cheese. 
                    <br>
                    - I have enjoyed playing video games most of my life. But recently, I have wanted to learn how to make them. So I 
                    have gathered the essentail resources and have started working on an idea, and I have listed the rest of my projects
                    to work on at a later date. Upon release of content, I will link my Steam account here as well.
